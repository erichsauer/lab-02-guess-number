export function 
// TDD a compareNumbers function that:

// Has two parameters: guess and correctNumber
// Returns one of the following values:
// 0 - the numbers are identical
// -1 - the guessed number is too low
// 1 - the guessed number is too high

// Write one test at a time, each test should address one of the three possible outcomes.

// SUPER STRETCH: Actually test for invalid input. You should throw an error if either parameter is not a number. Consult the QUnit docs for how to test for an exception.
